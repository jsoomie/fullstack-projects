## Projects
1. [Github Finder Repo](https://github.com/jsoomie/fullstack-projects/tree/main/github-finder) || [Deployed Link](https://githubfinder-ts.netlify.app/)
     - Create a github user finder application. Create fetch of github users with the use of a search bar. Create a clear bar after searching users. First, start using class components then refactor into functional components. Not fully full stack as there is no server, however this is just a stepping stone for what's to come.
2. [Contact Keeper Repo](https://github.com/jsoomie/fullstack-projects/tree/main/contact-keeper) || [WIP](#)
   -  Create full stack project as contact keeper. To be able to create contact info on certain user and save that info to MongoDB.
