1. [Github Finder Repo][github-finder] || [Deployed Link][github-finder-deployed]
     - Create a github user finder application. Create fetch of github users with the use of a search bar. Create a clear bar after searching users. First, start using class components then refactor into functional components. Not fully full stack as there is no server, however this is just a stepping stone for what's to come.
2. [Contact Keeper Repo][contact-keeper] || [WIP][contact-keeper-deployed]
   -  Create full stack project as contact keeper. To be able to create contact info on certain user and save that info to MongoDB.
